  <h1>It is a Cold Day</h1>

  <p>Helsinki is carrying a sharper chill today, with temperatures holding around 5 °C. The sun peeks through at times, but the air stays brisk, reminding everyone that autumn is edging closer to winter. Walking through the city, you’ll notice coats zipped higher and scarves pulled tighter, while the cool breeze off the Baltic gives the streets a fresh, crisp feel. As evening sets in, the cold will deepen, making it the perfect night for something warm indoors after a day in the brisk northern air.</p>
